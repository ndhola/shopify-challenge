# Shopify - Front End Developer Intern Challenge

## Technical Requirements:

1. Search results should come from NASA’s free APIs - Done (API URL: https://api.nasa.gov/#apod)
2. You are free to use any NASA API you like (API used: Astronomy Picture of the Day)
3. You are free to use any front end framework/component library you like (or none at all!) (React)
4. Each image result should list at least a title, date of capture (ideally in earth_date) and a button to “like” that image - Done
5. Each image can be “liked”, and a user should be able to undo their “like” - Done
6. The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic (MDN reference) - Done

## Additional Tasks:

- Save likes if the user leaves or reloads the page - not completed
- Animate the “like” action (might we suggest a heart?) - Completed (gives shadow on hover and click)
- Add a loading state while we wait for NASA’s API to return data - Completed
- Create shareable links for each image - Completed
- Add a date-picker to be able to browse photos starting from a specific date - not completed
